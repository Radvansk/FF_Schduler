			<h1>Fantasy Football Schedule Maker</h1>
			<p>I created this page because I always used the schedule maker on <a href="https://www.footballguys.com/schedule-maker" target="_blank">footballguys.com</a> and they rebuilt their site this year.</p>
			<p>Their new schedule maker is a disaster.  If your league plays division opponents twice, the new schedule maker no longer sets them for the first three weeks and last three weeks of the season.  I think the front and back of the schedule are important for division formats so teams have more potential to control their destiny down the stretch of the regular season.</p>
			<p>It will set division games for the first three weeks and then the rest of the division games are completely random.  Their page will have teams that play back-to-back in weeks three and four.</p>
			<p>This page resolves all of these issues.</u>
			<h2>Info & Directions</h2>
			<ul class="info">
				<li>This page is designed for 12-team leagues, with 3 divisions, and 14 regular season games.</li>
				<li>Division opponents play each other twice in weeks 1 - 3 and weeks 12 - 14.</li>
				<li>Each team will play all non-division teams once.</li>
				<li>The order you enter your divisions determine the division matchup structure.  The first team entered in each division will play the fourth team entered in week 1 and week 12.  This is because many leagues I play draft divisions, and its fun that the "drafter" gets to play their first pick in week 1 and their last pick in week 3.  Keep this rule in mind when entering the teams in each division.</p>
